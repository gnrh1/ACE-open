# ACE-Open Project Continuation Requirements

## Introduction

This document analyzes the current state of the ACE-Open (Agentic Context Engineering) framework and defines requirements for critical next steps to continue project development. The analysis is based on a comprehensive codebase review conducted on October 30, 2025.

## Glossary

- **ACE Framework**: The Agentic Context Engineering system that enables LLMs to self-improve through iterative context refinement
- **Playbook**: A structured context store containing bullet entries with helpful/harmful counters
- **Adaptation Loop**: The iterative process where Generator, Reflector, and Curator agents interact to improve the playbook
- **Test Coverage**: The percentage of code lines executed by automated tests (current: 81.18%)
- **Production Readiness**: The state where all Tier 1 critical tasks are complete and the system is deployable
- **Monitoring Module**: The ace/monitoring.py file providing Prometheus metrics (currently 0% coverage)

5. WHEN THE examples are documented, THE Documentation SHALL explain how to adapt each example to new domains

### Requirement 6: Implement Monitoring Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to visualize ACE adaptation metrics in real-time, so that I can understand playbook evolution and identify issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE monitoring system is configured, THE ACE System SHALL expose Prometheus metrics on a configurable HTTP endpoint
2. WHEN THE Grafana dashboard is imported, THE Monitoring System SHALL display adaptation loop performance metrics
3. WHEN THE Grafana dashboard is imported, THE Monitoring System SHALL display playbook growth and quality metrics
4. WHEN THE Grafana dashboard is imported, THE Monitoring System SHALL display LLM API latency and cost metrics
5. WHEN THE monitoring is active, THE ACE System SHALL update metrics in real-time during adaptation runs

### Requirement 7: Validate Security Audit Completeness

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to verify that all security vulnerabilities have been addressed, so that ACE can be deployed in production without risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE security tests are executed, THE Test System SHALL verify that path traversal attacks are prevented in checkpoint handling
2. WHEN THE security tests are executed, THE Test System SHALL verify that JSON DoS attacks are prevented with size limits
3. WHEN THE security tests are executed, THE Test System SHALL verify that API keys are never logged or exposed in error messages
4. WHEN THE security audit is reviewed, THE Documentation SHALL list all known limitations and mitigation strategies
5. WHEN THE security tests are executed, THE Test System SHALL achieve 100% pass rate on all 20 security test cases

### Requirement 8: Optimize Performance Bottlenecks

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to identify and optimize critical performance bottlenecks, so that ACE can handle large-scale experiments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
