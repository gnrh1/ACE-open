## How to Use This Documentation

### If you want to...

**Run MVP validation**
1. Read [MVP-SCOPE.md](./MVP-SCOPE.md)
2. Complete pre-flight checklist (10 min)
3. Run 3 examples (30-60 min)
4. Document results

**Understand what was built**
1. Read [design.md](./design.md) - Architecture overview
2. Check [tasks.md](./tasks.md) - See completed tasks (marked with ‚úÖ)
3. Review [CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md) - Detailed progress log

**Plan production deployment**
1. Read [tasks.md](./tasks.md) - See Task 3 onwards
2. Review [requirements.md](./requirements.md) - Understand requirements
3. Check [design.md](./design.md) - See deployment architecture

**Add new features**
1. Check [requirements.md](./requirements.md) - Ensure requirement exists
2. Update [design.md](./design.md) - Add design if needed
3. Add to [tasks.md](./tasks.md) - Create implementation tasks
4. Evaluate MVP impact - Update [MVP-SCOPE.md](./MVP-SCOPE.md) if critical

---

## Key Principles

### Single Source of Truth
- **tasks.md** is the authoritative task list
- Other documents are views/subsets, not replacements

### Clear Separation
- MVP scope is explicitly marked in both tasks.md and MVP-SCOPE.md
- No ambiguity about what's in/out of MVP

### Traceability
- Every task references requirements
- MVP tasks reference their tasks.md origin
- Changes propagate clearly

---

## Maintenance

### When MVP validation completes
1. Update [MVP-SCOPE.md](./MVP-SCOPE.md) with results
2. Mark validation status in [tasks.md](./tasks.md)
3. Prioritize remaining tasks based on findings

### When adding new tasks
1. Add to [tasks.md](./tasks.md) first (source of truth)
2. Evaluate if MVP-critical
3. Update [MVP-SCOPE.md](./MVP-SCOPE.md) only if MVP-critical

### When completing tasks
1. Mark complete in [tasks.md](./tasks.md)
2. Update [MVP-SCOPE.md](./MVP-SCOPE.md) if MVP task
3. Log in [CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md)

- **"What's the full scope?"** ‚Üí See [tasks.md](./tasks.md)
- **"What's been completed?"** ‚Üí Check ‚úÖ marks in [tasks.md](./tasks.md) or [CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md)
